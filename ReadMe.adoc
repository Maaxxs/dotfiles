== Installation

Clone the repository to `~/.dotfiles`

`git clone https://gitlab.com/Maaxxs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles/`

Look at `deploy.sh` and comment the lines for configurations you don't
want to change. Run it. What it will do for `~/.zshrc` for example. It
replaces the content with `source $HOME/.dotfiles/.zshrc` to load the
configuration which is stored in this git repository. This has 2
advantages: 

. Common configurations for all machines are saved to git
. You can add machine dependent configuration to the `~/.zshrc`,
  which is not stored in git.
